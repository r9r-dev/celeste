## v2.2.0 - 2026-01-07
### Added
* Add StackProvider interface and implementations (filesystem and mock) to abstract stack operations for better testability and dependency injection
* Add proxy configuration in vite.config.ts to route /api, /ws, and /health endpoints to backend during development
### Changed
* Refactor API handlers and server to use StackProvider interface instead of direct filesystem access, enabling dependency injection and better testing
* Update server main entry point to instantiate appropriate StackProvider (filesystem or mock) based on debug mode
